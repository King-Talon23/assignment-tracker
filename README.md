This program is meant to remind me of assignments and when they are due

It takes in the name of the class, the assignment and the due date

It's set up in the windows task scheduler to run every day at 8:30am, noon, 4pm, and 8pm

every time it runs it'll pop up in the corner of my screen displaying what i have due and when it's due
it priortizing whatevery assignment is closest to being due.
