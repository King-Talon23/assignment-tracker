This program is meant to remind me of assignments and when they are due

It's set up in the windows task scheduler to run every day at certain times, and passes an argument, -scheduled
to tell the program to remind me of assignments rather than except new ones

every time it is run by the scheduler it will pop up in the corner of my screen displaying what i have due and when it's due
it priortizing whatever assignment is closest to being due.

if it is ran by me it will have a pop-up with 3 text boses for the, the assignment course code, and the due date and it saves all the info a text file
